# Vintage-Photo-Restoration-Using-Traditional-Image-Processing-Techniques
Restoration of vintage photographs poses significant challenges in image processing due to the continuous occurrence of physical degradation over time. These photos are prone to fading, discoloration, scratches, and tears. To successfully restore these photos, it is necessary to not only remove noise and rectify damage but also to enhance faded features and colors, all without the use of extensive machine-learning techniques. This project aims to create a processing pipeline that employs traditional image processing techniques to recover and preserve the historical and sentimental value of vintage images. The image restoration procedure included numerous fundamental procedures, including grayscale conversion, histogram equalization, noise reduction, sharpening filter, morphological operations, edge detection, brightness adjustment, local contrast enhancement, artifact removal, and color restoration. The techniques used for image processing procedures somewhat recovered the vintage pictures. Contrast and brightness were much increased, while noise and artifacts were substantially eliminated. Adjusting the color channels gave the photographs a vivid, modern appearance while retaining their historical context. The finalized images demonstrated improved clarity, vibrant colors, and reduced noise, thereby meeting the project's objectives. Traditional image processing techniques, when used properly, can efficiently restore and update vintage pictures. This initiative highlights the potential of these techniques for improving image quality and preserving historical objects. Future research could look into more advanced approaches and automated systems to help enhance and streamline the restoration process.

# Methodology
The methodology for this project involves a methodical approach to recovering vintage pictures using traditional image processing techniques. The restoration process is separated into several key steps, each of which uses distinct algorithms and methodologies to accomplish the desired results. These procedures are as follows:

- Grayscale Conversion
- Gaussian Filter
- Apply Sharpening Filter
- Canny Edge Detection
- Apply Histogram Equalization
- Brightness Adjustment
- Morphological Operations (Closing)
- Local Contrast Enhancement Using Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE)
- Artifact Removal
- Color Restoration

# Result Evaluation
The results of this project demonstrate the effectiveness of traditional image processing techniques in achieving a significant improvement in image clarity, contrast, and overall appearance. By implementing our methodology, we have been able to restore the visual appear-
ance of the image to some extent. We were also able to give it a modern look ans still preserving its historical context.
